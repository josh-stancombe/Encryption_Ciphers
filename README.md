Caesar &amp; Vigen√®re Ciphers - Encoder &amp; Decoders

<br>

<b>Caesar Cipher</b><br>
Tool to decrypt/encrypt with Caesar. Caesar cipher (or Caesar code) is a shift cipher, one of the most easy and most famous encryption systems. It uses the substitution of a letter by another one further in the alphabet. To use: 
- Encrypt or Decrypt any message using another cipher such as - https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher
- Enter the message in the 'message' string variable (line 1) 
- Uncomment the function call to use decoder / encoder (line 50 & 51)
- Ammend the second function argument to be the shift number

<br>


<b>Vigenere Cipher</b><br>
Tool to decrypt/encrypt with Vigenere. Vigenere cipher is a poly-alphabetic substitution system that use a key and a double-entry table. To use: 
- Encrypt or Decrypt any message using another cipher such as - https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher
- Enter the message in the 'message' string variable (line 1) 
- Enter the keyword in the 'keyword' string variable (line 2)
- Uncomment the function call to use decoder / encoder (line 80 & 81)

<b>Future Feature Updates</b>
- Turn into a basic terminal program prompting the user to input a message and giving them the option to choose to encode to decrypt.
